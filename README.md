# Tenzies

This is a game where players roll a bunch of dice (let's say 10 dice) and all dice should end up showing the same number.

How to play:

-   Roll all the 10 dice at once.
-   Select the number that appears the most times on the dice and keep those dice aside.
-   Roll the remaining dice again, if they match your chosen number, then keep those dice aside as well.
-   Repeat the process until all the dice have the same number.

## Project Description

This project replicates the game **_Tenzies_**.

-   Click the "Roll" button to roll the dice.
-   To hold the dice with your chosen number, click on the die and it changes color, indicating selection.
-   Repeat the same steps again until all dice match.
-   Once all dice match, Confetti will appear, and the "Roll" button will change to "New Game". Click it to start again.
